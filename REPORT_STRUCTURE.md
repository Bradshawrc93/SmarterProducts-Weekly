## 🔧 **Data Mapping**

### **Google Sheets Data Structure Expected**

Each weekly tracker sheet (with date tab like "10/27/25") should contain these columns:

| Column Name | Purpose | OpenAI Usage |
|:------------|:--------|:-------------|
| **Product Team Name** | Team identifier | Section header |
| **General Update** | Weekly progress summary | Direct pull |
| **Key Wins** | Major accomplishments | Direct pull |
| **Next Week Focus** | Upcoming priorities | Direct pull |
| **Risk** | Current risks | Bullet point |
| **Blockers** | Current blockers | Bullet point |
| **General Sentiment** | Team morale/feeling | Optional inclusion |

### **Jira Data Mapping**

For each Jira board (mapped to product teams):

| Metric | Calculation | Time Window |
|:-------|:------------|:------------|
| **Issues Completed** | Count of issues moved to "Done" status | Previous Monday → This Tuesday |
| **Issues In Progress** | Count of issues in active development | Current snapshot |
| **New Issues Created** | Count of newly created issues | Previous Monday → This Tuesday |
| **Average Cycle Time** | Average days from "In Progress" → "Done" | Last 30 days |
| **% Done vs Committed** | Completed vs planned (for sprint teams) | Current sprint |

## 🤖 **OpenAI Processing Instructions**

### **Input Data Format to OpenAI**

The system will send this structured data to OpenAI:

```json
{
  "reporting_period": {
    "start_date": "10/27/25",
    "end_date": "11/4/25", 
    "report_date": "11/6/25"
  },
  "teams": [
    {
      "team_name": "SmarterAR",
      "google_sheet_data": {
        "general_update": "Completed portal integration...",
        "key_wins": "Successfully deployed Medicare extraction...",
        "next_week_focus": "Focus on Medicaid portal specs...",
        "risk": "Potential delay in third-party API...",
        "blockers": "Waiting for client approval on...",
        "general_sentiment": "Team is confident and motivated"
      },
      "jira_data": {
        "issues_completed": 8,
        "issues_in_progress": 12,
        "new_issues_created": 5,
        "average_cycle_time": 4.2,
        "percent_done_vs_committed": 85
      }
    }
  ],
  "raw_jira_summary": "Overall 33 issues across all boards...",
  "raw_sheets_summary": "4 sheets processed with weekly data..."
}
```

### **OpenAI Output Requirements**

OpenAI should return:

1. **Refined Summary**: Synthesized overview of all team data
2. **Enhanced Team Sections**: Improved readability and flow for each team
3. **Cross-Team Insights**: Analysis of patterns, risks, and interdependencies
4. **Proper Formatting**: Clean markdown with tables and structure

## 📊 **Visual Elements**

### **Jira Metrics Table Format**
```markdown
**Jira Snapshot:**  
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|:--------|:-------|:------|
| Issues Completed | 8 | (From 10/27–11/4 window) |
| Issues In Progress | 12 | Active development |
| New Issues Created | 5 | Incoming scope or work items |
| Average Cycle Time | 4.2 days | Time from start → done |
| % Done vs Committed | 85% | (for sprint-based teams) |
```

### **Work Items Shipped Visualization**
The "number of work items being shipped each week" will be prominently displayed in the **Issues Completed** metric, with clear time window notation.

## 🔄 **Data Flow Process**

1. **Data Collection**: System pulls from 4 Google Sheets (date-based tabs) + Jira boards
2. **Data Structuring**: Formats data into the JSON structure above
3. **OpenAI Processing**: Sends structured data with specific prompts
4. **Report Generation**: OpenAI returns refined, readable report
5. **Document Creation**: System creates Google Doc with final formatted report

## 🎯 **Key Improvements**

### **From Raw Data to Polished Report:**
- **Raw Google Sheet entries** → **Refined, readable updates**
- **Jira metrics** → **Contextualized performance indicators**
- **Individual team data** → **Cross-team insights and patterns**
- **Technical details** → **Executive-friendly summaries**

### **Focus on Shipping Velocity:**
- **Issues Completed** prominently featured as primary shipping metric
- **Clear time windows** for all metrics
- **Trend analysis** when possible (comparing to previous weeks)

## 📝 **Template Customization**

The report structure can be customized by:

1. **Modifying column names** in Google Sheets
2. **Updating the data mapping** in `services/content_generator.py`
3. **Adjusting OpenAI prompts** in `config/prompts/`
4. **Adding new metrics** from Jira or Sheets

This structure ensures consistent, professional reports that highlight team progress and shipping velocity while providing the executive summary and cross-team insights needed for strategic decision-making.
